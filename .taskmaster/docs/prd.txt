## 1. Introduction & Vision

### 1.1. Product Name
TerraFlow

### 1.2. Mission Statement
To be the indispensable AI partner for every real estate professional in India, empowering them to achieve peak performance and redefine success in the industry.

### 1.3. Vision: The AI Operating System for Real Estate
TerraFlow is not a simple CRM; it is the central **AI Operating System (OS)** for the modern real estate business. It integrates a suite of proactive, autonomous AI agents to automate mission-critical tasks, provide predictive insights, and secure transactions, allowing our users to focus on high-value work like building relationships and closing deals.

### 1.4. The Core Problem We Solve
The Indian real estate market is plagued by operational inefficiencies, a lack of data transparency, and significant compliance risks. Agents and developers lose thousands of hours to manual tasks, struggle to identify high-intent leads, and face complex hurdles like RERA compliance and E-Khata verification. TerraFlow is built to solve these specific, high-stakes problems.

## 4. High-Level User Flow & Journey

1.  **Discovery (Marketing Pages):** A potential user discovers TerraFlow through our premium landing page. They interact with the "Terra" chatbot to get their questions answered and see a custom ROI projection. Convinced, they sign up for a demo or a trial.

2.  **Onboarding (Internal Automation):** The user's form submission is saved to our internal Supabase CRM and triggers an n8n workflow, which sends a welcome email and notifies our team on Slack.

3.  **First Login (The Dashboard):** The user logs in and is greeted by the "Terra AI Orb" on their main dashboard. They see a clear overview of their business and are prompted to connect data or add their first lead/property.

4.  **Daily Use (The Core Loop):**
    *   **Agent:** Manages their pipeline in `TerraLead`, creates content in `TerraScribe`, and tracks commissions in `Analytics`.
    *   **Developer:** Tracks project timelines in `SmartFlow`, analyzes new site opportunities in `MarketIntel`, and verifies legal documents in `TerraSecure`.

5.  **Power User (Automation):** An experienced user opens the `SmartFlow` studio and builds a custom workflow: "When a new lead is added, wait 5 minutes, then have Terra call them. If they are interested, book a meeting in my Google Calendar and update their status to 'Appointment Scheduled' in the CRM."
